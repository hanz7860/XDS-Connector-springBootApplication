Store Credentials Securely
In src/main/resources/application.properties, add your XDS credentials:

xds.username=your-username
xds.password=your-password


Note: Replace your-username and your-password with your actual credentials.
Ensure that application.properties is excluded from version control

(e.g., add it to .gitignore) to prevent exposing sensitive information.
