Explanation
XML Parsing Service (XmlParsingService): Parses the XML file, attempts to find elements under the xxx tag, and falls back to x2x if xxx is not found. It stores the key-value pairs in a HashMap.

XDS Connection Service (XdsConnectionService): Makes an HTTP GET request to the XDS endpoint using the provided URL and basic authentication (username and password). It returns the response body as a string.

Controller (XdsController): Exposes two endpoints:

/api/parse-xml: Triggers the XML parsing and returns the key-value pairs.
/api/connect-xds: Connects to the XDS using one of the URLs, retrieves the data, and returns it.
RestTemplate Configuration: Configures a RestTemplate bean to be used for making HTTP requests.
